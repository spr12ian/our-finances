# Our finances

This project uses the `src/` layout to store all Python packages and modules.

Benefits:

- Prevents accidental imports from the current working directory
- Keeps project structure clean and modular
- Plays well with tools like `pytest`, `mypy`, and `setuptools`
- Mirrors the environment of an installed package
